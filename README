Back-End Project

You'll be creating a tool that syncs contacts from MockAPI to Mailchimp. For this integration, you will need to get each contact's first name, last name, and email address from MockAPI and create them as new members of a new list on Mailchimp. The new list on Mailchimp should have your personal name (e.g.: Gabriel Kugel).
